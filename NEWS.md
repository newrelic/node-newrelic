### v1.0.0 (2013-10-24):

* General release. No code changes from v0.12.1.

### v0.12.1 / beta-38 (2013-10-17):

* The transaction namer wasn't respecting error_collector.ignore_error_codes.
  We've unified the code paths there so that this no longer happens, so that
  if the status code of a request is in the list of codes to be ignored, it's
  no longer rolled up under that status code and gets its normal name.

### v0.12.0 / beta-37 (2013-10-16):

* Changed how MongoDB, MySQL, memcached, and Redis metrics are reported to New
  Relic. This is part of a larger effort to make the Monitoring > Database tab
  of the New Relic UI more useful for Node developers. There will be a brief
  period where your dashboards will have both the old and new metrics, which
  could lead to some temporary duplication or metric names. These "duplicates"
  will gradually stop showing up as the reporting windows containing the old
  metric names expire. Be sure to let us know if you have strong feelings one
  way or another about this change, as it's a work in progress.
* Updated the module's dependencies to fix another subtle bug in how
  error-handling works in Node 0.8.x. This should resolve the errors some users
  were seeing.

### v0.11.9 / beta-36 (2013-10-12):

* Fixed a crash in the tracer that could turn a recoverable application error
  into an unrecoverable process crash. Mea culpa, our apologies for the
  inconvenience if you ran into this. In our defence, the errors we're running
  into are getting ever more exotic as we get most of the common stuff nailed
  down.
* Added the ability to use the preconfigured Azure Web Server name as the
  application name for a Node app. Thanks to New Relic .NET engineer Nick Floyd
  for the suggestion.

### v0.11.8 / beta-35 (2013-10-11):

* Added a license entry to package.json.
* Due to an npm bug, the module package got huge. This one is much smaller.

### v0.11.7 / beta-34 (2013-10-11):

* The last build of the agent had a flaw in how it dealt with outbound requests
  that made it way too stringent about dealing with default ports. It is now
  more sane about defaults.
* The behavior of configuration precedence is slightly different now.
  Previously, if there were list values set in the defaults, configuration
  file, environment variables, or server-side configuration, they would be
  concatenated instead of being overwritten.  This made it impossible to
  override some of the defaults (most notably, it was impossible to not ignore
  HTTP status code 404 in the error tracer), so now the configuration file will
  overwrite the defaults, and environment variables will overwrite the
  configuration file.  Values sent by New Relic will still be concatenated
  instead of overwriting, though (again, this only affects configuration
  variables with list values). Thanks to GitHub user grovr for identifying
  the problem!
* The error tracer will collect errors off transactions after the first harvest
  cycle (thanks to GitHub user grovr for identifying this issue).
* `cluster` users will no longer see occasional crashes due to New Relic's
  instrumentation.
* Fixed a few minor documentation errors that made it tough to use the
  suggested ignoring rules for socket.io transactions.

### v0.11.6 / beta-33 (2013-10-08):

* Changed the module to not load the instrumentation *at all* if the agent is
  disabled via configuration. This will keep the module from leaking any
  resources when it's disabled.
* The agent used to include query parameters in the name for outbound requests,
  making for unwieldy-looking trace segments.  Those parameters are now
  stripped off, and if `capture_params` (and `ignored_params`) are enabled,
  parameters will be captured for (nicely-formatted) display.
* Added a stubbed API so that when the agent is disabled, calls to the New
  Relic API will not throw. Add naming calls to your code with impunity!
* The module now looks in many more places for `newrelic.js` before complaining
  that it can't be found. In order, it looks in the current working directory,
  the directory of the Node process's main module (normally whatever file you
  pass to node on the command line), the directory pointed to by the
  environment variable `NEW_RELIC_HOME`, the current process's `$HOME`, and the
  directory above the node_modules directory where `newrelic` is installed.

### v0.11.5 / beta-32 (2013-10-03):

* Fixed a major issue in the transaction tracer that affected users of certain
  Express middleware plugins. HUGE thanks to Nicolas Laplante for his
  assistance in isolating and reproducing the bug, and also to the denizens of
  #libuv for eyeballing my various unsuccessful attempts at a fix.
* Fixed another issue in the tracer where certain objects were being wrapped
  too many times. Thanks to José F. Romaniello for confirming the fix.
* Changed how requests handled by Express and Restify routes are named. This
  change is being rolled out both in this module and on the New Relic website,
  so there is a chance you will see the same route (or very similiar routes)
  show up twice in aggregated metrics.
* Dropped the default apdex tolerating value from 500 milliseconds to 100
  milliseconds. This means that transactions slower than 400 milliseconds will
  generate slow transaction traces. Read the documentation in README.md on
  `apdex_t` and `apdex_f` for further details.

### v0.11.4 / beta-31 (2013-10-01):

* Fixed an error in the Connect and Express middleware instrumentation. Another
  tip of the hat to Jeff Howell at Kabam for identifying this problem and
  pointing to a solution!

### v0.11.3 / beta-30 (2013-10-01):

* Rewrote the MongoDB instrumentation. Big thanks to Jeff Howell at Kabam for
  demonstrating a much more reliable and simple approach than what we had
  before! Also expanded the number of MongoDB methods instrumented to include
  more of the common operations and indexing operations.
* Changed the default value of the `top_n` configuration parameter. Read the
  documentation in `lib/config.default.js` for the details (we've taken another
  run at making the docs for `top_n` easier to understand), but the upshot is
  that by default you should see a greater diversity of slow transaction traces
  now.
* Closed a hole in the transaction tracer related to Connect and Express-style
  middleware chains.
* Fixed issues identified by testing against various versions of 0.11 and
  master.
* Added guidelines for contributing to the module. Read CONTRIBUTING.md
  for details.

### v0.11.2 / beta-29 (2013-09-25):

* Fixed a bug with the Connect instrumentation that would cause it to
  crash when using Connect's static middleware in strict mode. Using
  ES5 future reserved keywords for function names is a bad idea, and
  this is why, but static's name is highly unlikely to change. For
  those of you who are examining the state of your middleware stack after
  configuring it, you probably shouldn't be doing that, but if you run into
  problems with the New Relic agent installed, try changing your test to use
  `name.indexOf('whatever') === 0` as the predicate instead of
  `name === 'whatever'`.

### v0.11.1 / beta-28 (2013-09-24):

* Prevent requests from being double-counted by changing the tracer to
  always reuse existing transactions rather than trying to nest them.
* Changed the Connect instrumentation to preserve the names of middleware
  functions after wrapping them. If you need this change, you should
  probably change your code so you don't need it anymore.
* Added a bunch of server-side configuration options that are known but
  unsupported to the agent.

### v0.11.0 / beta-27 (2013-09-20):

* IMPORTANT. There have been MAJOR CHANGES in how requests are named for
  display and aggregation in the New Relic user interface. Read the section in
  the README on transactions and request naming for details. For good measure,
  read it twice. If your requests are all still ending up named `/*`, read
  it a third time. This is **especially** true if you're not using Express
  or Restify, in which case you will almost certainly want to make changes
  in how you configure New Relic.
* IMPORTANT. New Relic for Node.js now supports the full range of server-side
  configuration options offered by the New Relic web interface. By default,
  server-side settings will override the settings in your configuration file
  (or environment variables). You can disable server-side configuration by
  setting `ignore_server_configuration` to `true` in your configuration file
  (or setting `NEW_RELIC_IGNORE_SERVER_CONFIGURATION` to 'true').
* BREAKING CHANGE: The New Relic module now exports an API to be used for
  naming transactions and for adding URL to transaction name mapping rules. If
  you were using `require('newrelic')` as an interface to the agent's
  configuration or its internals, you'll need to fix your code (also you
  probably shouldn't have been doing that).
* BREAKING CHANGE: The configuration parameter
  `transaction_tracer.trace_threshold` has been renamed
  `transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold` to make it consistent with New
  Relic's other agents.
* Applications using the Express or Restify routers will now have their
  requests named after the matching routes. These names can be overridden
  but the transaction-naming API.
* There are new configuration parameters for adding rules for naming or
  ignoring requests. The README has a good example for how to keep socket.io
  from blowing out your average response time. You should read it!
* Tweaked the calculation of exclusive time in transaction traces, which
  should make more of the transaction trace detail pages make sense.

### v0.10.3 / beta-26 (2013-08-25):

* Fixed a regression in `beta-25` that caused the agent to incorrectly
  calculate an important timestamp, thus leading to data not showing up
  in New Relic.
* Improved in-memory aggregation (when the connection between the agent
  and New Relic is unavailable or failing).

### v0.10.2 / beta-25 (2013-08-23):

* Fixed a serious error in how the agent handles communication errors
  when sending errors to New Relic. If you're running v0.10.0 or v0.10.1,
  upgrade sooner rather than later, as those versions are losing data.
* Substantially improved the quality of reporting on errors noticed by the
  Node agent. Stack traces, scopes, and messages should be much better.

### v0.10.1 / beta-24 (2013-08-19):

* The instrumentation for `http` no longer assumes that the hostname for
  external requests will be named `host` (`hostname` is also allowed, and
  `http.request()` defaults to `localhost`).
* The Node agent and New Relic's servers disagreed about what many metrics
  should be called. The agent was wrong and it regrets the error.
* Minor tweaks to database instrumentation (MongoDB and MySQL) that could have
  a small but visible impact on the overview display.

### v0.10.0 / beta-23 (2013-08-17):

* IMPORTANT. The transaction tracer in this build is COMPLETELY NEW. This means
  that the agent will probably work just fine under Node 0.8 and newer, but
  Node versions 0.6 and older are presently unsupported, and support for them
  may or may not come back. However, the quality of the metrics gathered by the
  agent is now vastly improved.
* There are over 100 commits included in this build. Every effort has been made
  to ensure that we will not crash your applications, but be aware there may be
  regressions.
* Substantially more information is displayed by New Relic for slow transaction
  traces. How this information is displayed is a work in progress, as New Relic
  works to create a consistent user experience for developers writing both
  synchronous and asynchronous applications.
* Most Redis and memcached operations will now provide details on which keys
  were involved in an operation.
* The error tracer has been given a new coat of paint as well, and takes better
  advantage of Node domains, when they're available. Fewer errors should be
  double-counted, as well.
* MongoDB instrumentation is substantially improved.
* Express instrumentation now deals with the removal of the (very helpful)
  version field from recent versions of Express.
* Exclusive durations are reported for metrics, improving transaction
  breakdowns.
* Several bugs in the communication between the New Relic agent and New Relic's
  servers have been fixed.
* Failed connection attempts between the agent and New Relic's servers no longer
  cause aggregated metrics to be lost, nor will this trigger an agent crash.

### v0.9.22 / beta-22 (2013-06-11):

* Capture request URL before Express can mess with it.

### v0.9.21 / beta-21 (2013-06-04):

* Don't try to connect without a license key.
* Clear out previous connection listeners on failed connection attempts.
* Don't crash when normalizing paths without a leading slash.

### v0.9.20 / beta-20 (2013-03-28):

* The implementation of domains changed in Node 0.10.x, which necessitated
  a fair amount of work on the error tracer to preserve the existing
  error tracer behavior.
* The error tracer no longer improperly swallows thrown errors.
* The agent no longer assumes that a home directory is set.
* The agent now works correctly with the `should` assertion helper
  library.

### v0.9.19 / beta-19 (2013-03-04):

* HTTPS instrumentation is both more complete and far better tested.
* Restify servers using HTTPS listeners should now be properly
  instrumented.

### v0.9.18-137 / beta-18 (2013-01-30):

* `;` is now treated as a query separator in URLs, just like `?`.
* When using `stdout` or `stderr` for logging and not using a configuration
  file, logging will now work as expected.
* The error-handling code for DNS lookup of New Relic's servers was itself
  erroneous.  It should no longer crash instrumented apps when DNS lookup
  fails.
* Simplified agent startup process.

### v0.9.17-132 / beta-17 (2013-01-24):

* Using fs.readdir will no longer crash the agent and your apps. Oops!
* Added error-tracing middleware for Connect 1 & 2 applications, which includes
  Express 2 and 3 applications. This middleware is inserted automatically and
  transparently. Because it's common for end-user error handlers to not
  propagate errors (by calling next(error) from within the handler), the
  instrumentation inserts the middleware before the first error handler added
  to the middleware chain.
* The node-redis driver now correctly traces Redis calls made without a
  callback.
* Connections to New Relic that partially succeeded will now correctly keep
  attempting to connect until the connection succeeds or the number of retries
  is exhausted.
* Added a handler for yet another kind of New Relic server error
  (RuntimeError).

### v0.9.16-121 / beta-16 (2013-01-16):

* For some of the modules instrumented by the agent (fs, http, Express 2
  and 3), the error tracer now adds error tracing to wrapped function calls.
  This means that more of the functions in those modules will send traced
  errors to New Relic, even if they're trapping errors themselves. Also
  improves error tracer in versions of Node without domains. The error
  tracer rethrows all caught errors, so as to not alter behavior of
  instrumented apps.
* The error count sent by the agent was frequently incorrect due to an
  off-by-one bug.
* Include the entire stacktrace in traced errors.
* When the agent fails to successfully connect to New Relic's servers, it
  will try 6 more times, progressively waiting longer between each failed
  attempt. If no connection can be made, the agent will shut itself down.
* The agent no longer crashes instrumented applications when DNS resolution
  fails during the initial handshake with New Relic's servers. It logs the
  failures instead and retries later.
* The agent no longer alters the behavior of the generic-pool module in a
  way that causes modules using it to break (including node-postgres).
* In some cases, the domains-based error tracer was not working correctly.
* The agent logs significantly more useful debugging information.

### v0.9.15-107 / beta-15 (2013-01-14):

* The agent's built-in compression for sending large payloads to New Relic
	wasn't correctly handling the Buffer returned by zlib, leading to a crash.

### v0.9.14-105 / beta-14 (2013-01-07):

* In some cases, the monkeypatching used by the instrumentation wasn't
  written sufficiently defensively, leading to applications crashing at
  startup when using the agent.
* Changed how packages and dependencies are serialized when sent to New
  Relic's servers.

### v0.9.13-101 / beta-13 (2013-01-07):

* When New Relic's servers (or an intermediate proxy) returned a response with
  a status code other than 20x, the entire instrumented application would
  crash.
* Some metric normalization rules were not being interpreted correctly, leading
  to malformed normalized metric names.
* Metric normalization rules that specifed that matching metrics were to be
  ignored were not being enforced.

### v0.9.12-91 / beta-12 (2012-12-28):

* Fixed the agent's auto-restart support to cleanly shut down the
  connection (also fixed a bunch of bugs in restart).

### v0.9.11-88 / beta-11 (2012-12-20):

* When server-side configuration changes, the agent will now correctly
  restart when told to do so by New Relic's servers.
* Correctly wrap net.Server.prototype.listen -- wasn't returning the
  server object, which broke some apps.
* If you're on a SmartOS VM with a 64-bit base image and a 64-bit build of
  Node that's v0.8.5 or earlier, the agent will no longer cause Node to
  crash. Don't even ask.

### v0.9.10-85 / beta-10 (2012-12-13):

* Squared up the environment variable names with existing practice,
  especially with an eye towards conformity with Heroku documentation.
* Flushed out all configuration used anywhere in the agent and made sure
  it was documented in config.default.js.
* Using the new environment setting NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE, override the
  need to have a settings file at all.
* Add the ability to send log output to stdout or stderr.

### v0.9.9-82 / beta-09 (2012-12-12):

* Can now configure the agent via environment variables. See README.md for
  details.
* Can now configure the location of the agent log via either logging.filepath
  in the configuration file, or NR_LOGGING_FILEPATH in the app's environment.
* Turning off the error tracer via configuration now actually disables it.

### v0.9.7-75 / beta-08 (2012-12-06):

* Express view rendering was being instrumented improperly before, causing
  rendering to fail and Express to hang. Both Express 2 and 3 were affected,
  and both have been fixed.
* When NODE_PATH is set, resolve NODE_PATH elements properly so that package
  lookup for environmental information gathering doesn't crash the app.
* Now send the Node version along with the rest of the environment data.

### v0.9.6-70 / beta-07 (2012-11-30):

* Added first cut at support for error tracing via Node.js 0.8+ domains.
  Versions of Node.js that support it (v0.8.9 and above) will make a
  best-faith effort to clean up after errors.
* Improved non-domain error handling on outbound HTTP requests.
* Dramatically improved accuracy of HTTP request timing.

### v0.9.5-63 / beta-06 (2012-11-28):

* Be more careful in dealing with HTTP requests.

### v0.9.4-61 / beta-05 (2012-11-26):

* Further improvements to node-mongodb-native instrumentation.
* Package now available via npm as "newrelic".

### v0.9.3-57 / beta-04 (2012-11-06):

* Send a list of the packages and dependencies available to an app on
  connection to New Relic servers.
* Generally cleaned up submission of configuration information.
* Added trace-level logging of instrumentation to help diagnose issues
  with transaction tracing.
* Fixes to web error transaction reporting.

### v0.9.2-53 / beta-03 (2012-11-02):

* Added support for node-mysql 2.0.0a driver series.
* Added support for Express 3.
* Added rudimentary instrumentation for node-redis.
* Added rudimentary support for generic-pool (for use with MySQL).
* Fixed view instrumentation for Express.
* Improved coverage of MongoDB driver.
* Many small fixes to make logging more robust.
* Don't return a partially initialized agent -- shut agent down
  gracefully if startup fails.

### v0.9.1-46 / beta-02 (2012-10-01):

* Fixed an issue in how transaction traces were serialized that kept them from
  being displayed within RPM.
* Added request parameters to transaction traces, as well as URL normalization.
* Reconciled segment names in transaction traces with the corresponding
  metric names.
* Changed the logging module to bunyan. This means that logs are now stored
  as JSON. If you want pretty-printed logs, `npm install -g bunyan` and then
  use the bunyan CLI tool to format and filter the logs.
* The agent now sets the logging level to the configured level. Logs sent to
  New Relic should have been captured at the 'trace' level for the duration
  of the beta.
* Fixed metric -> ID renaming semantics.
* Verified that agent works with Node 0.8's cluster module.

### v0.9.0-39 / beta-01 (2012-09-28):

* Completely new transaction tracer. Faster, simpler and vastly more
  deterministic, but the reworking likely introduced a bunch of new bugs. This
  also means that the agent no longer directly affects the call stack or
  overrides any of the core event-handling methods, which means the overhead
  of the transaction tracer is vastly reduced. Which is good, because you
  still can't turn it off.
* Transaction traces should now report the correct caller-callee relationships.
* Transaction tracer is now internally instrumented, for better debugging.
* Added support for Restify.
* Using the Node.js agent in Restify app no longer causes them to crash
  (fixes NA-47).
* Improved support for Express (NA-8).
* Lots of fixes to the MongoDB, MySQL and memcached instrumentation.
* MongoDB instrumentation no longer crashes MongoDB apps that include
  the agent (NA-48).
* More testing in Node.js 0.6.x (hard to completely test, as node-tap isn't
  that friendly to Node < 0.6.21).

### v0.8.5-34 / alpha-06 (2012-09-24):

* Transaction trace durations are now reported properly (were seconds, now
  milliseconds).
* The agent no longer causes Restify applications to crash.
* The internal Node metrics sampler now shuts itself down properly.

### v0.8.4-30 / alpha-05 (2012-09-20):

* Improved timing of Express / Connect request handlers.

### v0.8.3-28 / alpha-04 (2012-09-19):

* Added support for internal supportability metrics (enabled via setting
  debug.internal_metrics to true in newrelic.js).

### v0.8.2-26 / alpha-03 (2012-09-14):

* By popular demand, support for Node 0.6.x. Tested against versions
  0.6.5 and 0.6.19.

### v0.8.1-25 / alpha-02 (2012-09-14):

* Transaction traces no longer crash the RPM transaction trace viewer.
* The Node.js agent now follows the rules for Top N slow trace gathering.
* Compress large requests before submitting them to the New Relic
  collector.
* trace_threshold can now be configured from the server, and is not
  hard coded to apdex_f.
* The agent definitely doesn't work (for now) in Node 0.6.x and earlier.
  The agent will now notify developers (on the console) that it's refusing
  to start up under old versions, but won't crash the app.
* Don't crash the instrumented app if config is missing.

### v0.8.0-21 / alpha-01 (2012-09-11);

* The agent faithfully records and reports basic metrics.
* The agent reports error metrics.
* The agent gathers basic slow transaction trace data.
* The agent reports transaction trace data.
