# New Developer Setup

## Machine Setup (Mac)

- [ ] [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [ ] [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)`)
- [ ] XCode (`xcode-select --install`) or command-line tools for XCode or however Mac OS does this in the future
- [ ] Git setup: `brew install git`, then SSL key/certificate, username, etc. ([SSH help](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account))
- [ ] NVM (`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash`, check [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for latest version)
- [ ] [Node though NVM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (`nvm install 20`, or latest version instead of 20)
- [ ] `brew install postgresql` (c library required for pg-native tests)
- [ ] Text Editor / IDE
- [ ] Swap OpenSSL (if necessary, see below)

### Swapping OpenSSL for LibreSSL

LibreSSL doesnâ€™t seem to work w/ our make/tests that rely on OpenSSL functionality.

To fix:

1. Install openssl via homebrew (`brew install openssl`)
2. Execute `brew info openssl`
3. Copy/Paste instructions for "If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:..." section.

## How We Work

Similar to public contributions, New Relic instrumentation team members also standardly work from their own forks of the main repository. This ensures the public contribution path is well known and exercised and also avoids a class of mistakes we've made in the past. In certain circumstances, working directly on a branch in the main repo may be ideal. This is fine but is not intended to be the standard.

All work is landed to the default branch which we deploy from. Deployments occur at the discretion of the instrumentation team depending on the types and quantity of changes landed to the main repository. When public contributions are landed, the team aims to ship these the same or following-week.

The instrumentation team primarily works via GitHub issues. In progress work can be tracked via the [Node.js Engineering Board](https://github.com/orgs/newrelic/projects/41).

See the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) doc for further information submitting issues and pull requests, running tests, etc.

### Forking

GitHub has a getting started guide on forking a repository here: https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo.

Don't forget to add your upstream remote!

`git remote add upstream git@github.com:newrelic/node-newrelic.git`

There are a variety of ways to get the latest changes into your local branches. Here's one way for quick reference:

1. `git checkout main`
2. `git pull upstream main`

### Testing

In addition to basic unit tests that can be run with `npm run unit`, we have
a set of "versioned" integration style tests. See the [package.json](../package.json)
for the full set of scripts, but a short list of common scenarios is:

+ `npm run versioned:internal` - to run all versioned tests across all supported
  versions of each instrumented module.
+ `npm run versioned:internal:major` - to run all versioned tests for each
  current major release of each instrumented module.
+ `npm run versioned:internal:major foo` - to run a specific versioned test
  for the latest major version of the instrumented module named "foo" (as an
  example).

Note: when running the versioned test suite on a macOS system, the application
firewall is likely to issue multiple requests to authorize the `node` binary
for incoming connections. This can be avoided by running the
[macos-firewall.sh](../bin/macos-firewall.sh) script to prime the application
firewall with a rule to allow the connections:

```sh
$ sudo ./bin/macos-firewall.sh
```
