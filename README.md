# New Relic Node.js agent

Make sure you have a New Relic account before starting. Until the end of the
beta, you'll want to have access to Pro features like slow transaction traces.
Contact your New Relic representative to see about getting a trial upgrade for
the purposes of testing.

## Getting started

1. [Install node](http://nodejs.org/#download). For now, at least 0.6 is
   required. Some features (e.g. error tracing) depend in whole or in
   part on features in 0.8 and above. Development work on the agentis
   being done against the latest released non-development version of Node.
2. Install this module via `npm install newrelic` for the application you
   want to monitor.
3. Copy `newrelic.js` from `node_modules/newrelic` into the root directory of
   your application.
4. Edit `newrelic.js` and replace `license_key`'s value with the license key
   for your account.
5. Add `require('newrelic');` as the first line of the app's main module.
   *IMPORTANT*: formerly this was `require('newrelic_agent')`, and you *MUST*
   update your code.

If you wish to keep the configuration for the agent separate from your
application, the agent will look for newrelic.js in the directory referenced
by the environment variable `NEWRELIC_HOME` if it's set.

When you start your app, the agent should start up with it and start
reporting data that will appear within our UI after a few minutes.
Because the agent minimizes the amount of bandwidth it consumes, it
only reports data once a minute, so if you add the agent to tests
that take less than a minute to run, the agent won't have time to
report data to New Relic. The agent will write its log to a file named
`newrelic_agent.log` in the application directory. If the agent doesn't
send data or crashes your app, the log can help New Relic determine what
went wrong, so be sure to send it along with any bug reports or support
requests.

## Configuring the agent

The agent can be tailored to your app's requirements, both from the
server and via the newrelic.js configuration file you created. For more
details on what can be configured, refer to `lib/config.default.js`,
which documents the available variables and their default values.

In addition, for those of you running in Heroku, Microsoft Azure or any other
PaaS environment that makes it easier to control configuration via the your
server's environment, all of the configuration variables in newrelic.js have
counterparts that can be set in your service's shell environment. You can
mix and match the configuration file and environment variables freely; the
value found from the environment will always take precedence.

This documentation will be moving to New Relic's servers with the 1.0 release,
but for now, here's a list of the variables and their values:

* `NEW_RELIC_HOME`: path to the directory in which you've placed newrelic.js.
* `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`: The name of this application, for reporting to
  New Relic's servers. This value can be also be a comma-delimited list of
  names.
* `NEW_RELIC_ENABLED`: Whether or not the agent should run. Good for
  temporarily disabling the agent while debugging other issues with your
  code.
* `NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE`: Inhibit loading of the configuration file
  altogether. Use with care. This presumes that all important configuration
  will be available via environment variables, and some log messages
  assume that a config file exists.
* `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`: Your New Relic license key.
* `NEW_RELIC_LOG`: Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including
  the filename. The agent will shut down the process if it can't create
  this file, and it creates the log file with the same umask of the
  process. Setting this to `stdout` will write all logging to stdout, and
  `stderr` will write all logging to stderr.
* `NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging priority for the New Relic agent. Can be one of
  `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`. `debug` and `trace` are
  pretty chatty; unless you're helping New Relic figure out irregularities
  with the agent, you're probably best off using `info` or higher.
* `NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED`: Whether or not to trace errors within
  your application. Values are `true` or `false`.
* `NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES`: Comma-delimited list of HTTP
  status codes to ignore. Maybe you don't care if payment is required?
* `NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED`: Whether to collect and submit slow
  transaction traces to New Relic. Values are `true` or `false`.
* `NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD`: Millisecond duration at which
  a transaction trace will count as slow and be sent to New Relic. Can
  also be set to `apdex_f`, at which point it will set the trace threshold
  to 4 times the current ApdexT.
* `NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N`: Number of transaction traces to send to New
  Relic on each 60-second harvest cycle. Defaults to 1. This can lead
  to noisy transaction traces and should be used with care.
* `NEW_RELIC_APDEX`: Set the initial Apdex tolerating / threshold value.
  This is more often than not set from the server.
* `NEW_RELIC_HOST`: Hostname for the New Relic collector proxy. You
  shouldn't need to change this.
* `NEW_RELIC_PORT`: Port number on which the New Relic collector proxy
  will be listening.
* `NEW_RELIC_DEBUG_METRICS`: Whether to collect internal supportability
  metrics for the agent. Don't mess with this unless New Relic asks you to.
* `NEW_RELIC_DEBUG_TRACER`: Whether to dump traces of the transaction tracer's
  internal operation. You're welcome to enable it, but it's unlikely to be
  edifying unless you're a New Relic Node.js engineer.
