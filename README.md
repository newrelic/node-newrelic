# New Relic's Node.js agent [![Server Smoke Tests][3]][4] [![Node Agent CI][5]][6]

[![npm status badge][1]][2]

This package instruments your application for performance monitoring with [New Relic](https://newrelic.com).

In order to take full advantage of this package, make sure you have a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com) before starting. Available features, such as slow transaction traces, will vary [based on account level](https://newrelic.com/application-monitoring/features).

As with any instrumentation tool, please test before using in production.

## Installation

To use New Relic's Node.js agent entails these three steps, which are described in detail below:

- Install [the `newrelic` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newrelic)
- Create a base configuration file
- Require the agent in your program

1. To install the agent for performance monitoring, use your favorite npm-based package manager and install the `newrelic` package into your application:

    `$ npm install newrelic`

2. Then, copy the stock configuration file to your program's base folder:

    `$ cp ./node_modules/newrelic/newrelic.js ./<your destination>`

3. Now, add your New Relic license key and application/service name to that file:

```js
    /* File: newrelic.js */
    'use strict'
    /**
     * New Relic agent configuration.
     *
     * See lib/config/default.js in the agent distribution for a more complete
     * description of configuration variables and their potential values.
     */
    exports.config = {
      app_name: ['Your application or service name'],
      license_key: 'your new relic license key',
      /* ... rest of configuration .. */
    }
```

4. Finally, run your program with the `newrelic` module loaded first by using node's `-r/--require` flag.

```
 $ node -r newrelic your-program.js
```

If you cannot control how your program is run, you can load the `newrelic` module _before any other module_ in your program.

```js
    const newrelic = require('newrelic')

    /* ... the rest of your program ... */
```

## Getting Started

For more information on getting started, [check the Node.js docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-nodejs).

### External Modules

There are several modules that can be installed and configured to accompany the Node.js agent:

 * [@newrelic/apollo-server-plugin](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-node-apollo-server-plugin): New Relic's official Apollo Server plugin for use with the Node.js agent.
 * [@newrelic/winston-enricher](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-winston-logenricher-node): Provides distributed trace and span information output as JSON-formatted log messages.  This is most commonly used with the New Relic Logs product.
 * [@newrelic/mysql](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic-mysql)(**Experimental**): Standalone instrumentation for [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2#readme) and [mysql2/promise](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/blob/master/documentation/Promise-Wrapper.md) as well as the same instrumentation for [mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql#readme) within the Node.js agent.

There are several modules included within the Node.js agent to add more instrumentation for 3rd party modules:

 * [@newrelic/aws-sdk](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic-aws-sdk):  Provides instrumentation for the [AWS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk) npm package.
 * [@newrelic/koa](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic-koa): Provides instrumentation for [koa](https://koajs.com/), [koa-router](https://github.com/ZijianHe/koa-router), [@koa/router](https://github.com/koajs/router), and [koa-route](https://github.com/koajs/route) npm packages.
 * [@newrelic/superagent](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic-superagent): Provides instrumentation for [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) npm package.
 * [@newrelic/native-metrics](https://github.com/newrelic/node-native-metrics): Provides hooks into the native v8 layer of Node.js to provide metrics to the Node.js agent.

## Usage

### Using the API

The `newrelic` module returns an object with the Node.js agent's API methods attached.

```js
    const newrelic = require('newrelic')

    /* ... */
    newrelic.addCustomAttribute('some-attribute', 'some-value')
```

You can read more about using the API over on the [New Relic documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/api-guides/guide-using-nodejs-agent-api) site.

## Testing

These are the steps to work on core agent features, with more detail below:

- Fork the agent
- Install its dependencies
- Run tests using `npm`

1. [Fork](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/fork) and clone this GitHub repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/node-newrelic.git
    $ cd node-newrelic

2. Install the project's dependences:

    $ npm install

Then you're all set to start programming.

### To run the test suite

1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Start the Docker services: `$ npm run services`
3. Run all the tests using `$ npm run test`

Available test suites include:

    $ npm run unit
    $ npm run integration
    $ npm run versioned
    $ npm run lint
    $ npm run smoke
