# Guidelines for Contributing Code

New Relic welcomes code contributions by the Node community to this module, and
have taken effort to make this process easy for both contributors and our
development team.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests should be submitted in the [Issue tracker](../../issues), with
a description of the expected behavior & use case. Before submitting an Issue,
please search for similar ones in the [closed
issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aenhancement).

## Pull Requests

We can only accept PRs for version v3.0.0 or greater due to open source
licensing restrictions.

## PR Guidelines

### Version Support

When contributing, keep in mind that New Relic customers (that's you!) are
running many different versions of Node, some of them pretty old. Changes that
depend on the newest version of Node will probably be rejected, especially if
they replace something backwards compatible.

Be aware that the instrumentation needs to work with a wide range of versions of
the instrumented modules, and that code that looks nonsensical or
overcomplicated may be that way for compatibility-related reasons. Read all the
comments and check the related tests before deciding whether existing code is
incorrect.

If you’re planning on contributing a new feature or an otherwise complex
contribution, we kindly ask you to start a conversation with the maintainer team
by opening up an Github issue first.

### General Guidelines

In general, we try to limit adding third-party production dependencies. If one
is necessary, please be prepared to make a clear case for the need.

### Coding Style Guidelines/Conventions

We use eslint to enforce certain coding standards. Please see our
[.eslintrc](./.eslintrc.js) file for specific rule configuration.

### Testing Guidelines

The superagent instrumentation module includes a suite of unit and functional
tests which should be used to verify your changes don't break existing
functionality.

Unit tests are stored in `tests/`. They're written in
[node-tap](https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap), and have the extension `.tap.js`.

Functional tests against specific versions of instrumented modules are stored
in `test/versioned/`. They are also written in `node-tap`.

#### Running Tests

Running the test suite is simple. Just run:

    npm test

This will install all the necessary modules and run the unit tests in standalone
mode, followed by the functional tests if all of the unit tests pass.

To just run unit tests, run the following:

    npm run unit

#### Writing Tests

For most contributions it is strongly recommended to add additional tests which
exercise your changes. This helps us efficiently incorporate your changes into
our mainline codebase and provides a safeguard that your change won't be broken
by future development. Because of this, we require that all changes come with
tests. You are welcome to submit pull requests with untested changes, but they
won't be merged until you or the development team have an opportunity to write
tests for them.

There are some rare cases where code changes do not result in changed
functionality (e.g. a performance optimization) and new tests are not required.
In general, including tests with your pull request dramatically increases the
chances it will be accepted.
