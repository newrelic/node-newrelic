/**
 * A metric is a set of aggregated data (summary statistics) associated with a
 * metric name. Some metrics belong to scopes, which are typically the name of
 * a transaction or a background task. This class is a collection of mappings
 * from names (or scopes and names) to data, as well as functions for
 * manipulating those data directly. It also can produce a serialized
 * representation suitable for stringifying into JSON and sending to the
 * collector.
 *
 * There are several metrics collections in existence at any given time. Each
 * agent has one metrics collection, which is created at the beginning of each
 * harvest cycle. Each new transaction also gets its own metrics collection,
 * which is merged into the agent's metrics when the transaction is finalized.
 * This allows each set of metrics to be added to the harvest cycle atomically,
 * which guarantees that each transaction will not have its metrics split
 * across multiple harvest cycles. If delivery to the collector fails, the
 * metrics collection associated with the failed delivery can be merged back
 * into the metrics collection for the ongoing harvest cycle.  Finally, if so
 * configured, the agent will have an internal set of supportability metrics
 * that can be used to report information about the operation of the agent.
 *
 * Metrics can be remapped, which is a process by which they are assigned a
 * short, numerical ID by New Relic. This can shrink the serialized JSON
 * considerably. The mapping from transaction name (and scope) happens only
 * at serialization time, which allows the mappings from name to ID to happen
 * on the fly.
 *
 * @param {Number} apdexT The apdex-tolerating value, for use in creating apdex
 *                        statistics.
 * @param {MetricMapper} mapper The mapper that turns metric names into IDs.
