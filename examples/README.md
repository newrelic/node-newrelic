# node-newrelic examples

We are in the process of migrating these examples over to [newrelic-node-examples](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-node-examples) as more robust applications. If you are looking for the api/background-transactions, api/distributed-tracing, or api/segments examples, they are now [here](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-node-examples/tree/main/custom-instrumentation) as stand-alone applications.

The *shim* subdirectory and its revised contents will also be moved over to newrelic-node-examples at a later date.

To request additional examples, please [file an issue](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/issues)!
