# This is intended to be called in any of our repos.
# To use you can look at `add-to-board.yml` as a reference.
# You should be able to just call `uses: newrelic/node-newrelic/.github/workflows/board.yml@main`
# If for some reason the "todo" or "needs pr" columns are different than the default, you can pass in
# via
# with:
#   todo_column: 'TODO Column'
#   pr_column: 'PR Column'
#
# If you do not want to add to the Node.js Engineering Board, you'll have to find the guid of the project
# by using the GitHub API
# `gh api -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.inertia-preview+json" orgs/newrelic/projects --jq ".[] | select(.name == \"<Name of Boarda>"\").id"`
#
# You can find a project via `orgs/newrelic/projects`, `repos/newrelic/<repo-name>/projects`
