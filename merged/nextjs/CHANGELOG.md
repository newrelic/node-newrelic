   * This will require customers to use New Relic Node.js version >= 9.7.1.
   * Please note that the integration with CodeStream is not finished. A future release of agent will enable code level metrics by default.

* Updated versioned tests to include v13 of Next.js.

### v0.3.1 (2022-10-17)

* Updated newrelic peer dependency to be >= 8.14.0. This makes the hasToRemoveScriptWrapper property available for api.getBrowserTimingHeader.

* **BREAKING**: Fixed instrumentation to only support middleware in `>=12.2.0` of Next.js
   * Next.js has made middleware [stable](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware).
   * All attempts in `@newrelic/next` to track middleware before 12.2.0 have been removed.

* Added an additional path to register `next-server` when running a Next.js app with a standalone server.

* Updated dev-dependencies to clear security audit warnings.

### v0.1.1 (2022-04-04)

* Added support for middleware in > 12.1.1 of Next.js.  The return of `getModuleContext` is now an async function.

### v0.1.0 (2022-03-01)
 * Initial release of the Node.js Next.js instrumentation.
   * Transaction naming based on Next.js page or API route.
